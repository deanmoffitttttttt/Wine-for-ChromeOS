# Wine-for-ChromeOS
Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on Linux, macOS, &amp; BSD. You can now install it on a Chromebook using these commands (or by executing the .bash file) and run Windows apps on your Chromebook. Note that this is not official.
